# Auction Bidding Mechanism




## Please Note that...

I am a beginner currently pursuing my undergraduate degree. I developed this auction bidding mechanism using MERN stack with Typescript from scratch as a part of my learning journey. While I may be new to the field, this project showcases my dedication to learning and building practical applications. I welcome any reveiw, feedback, and suggestions for improvement, as they will help me grow as a developer.


## Overview
This MERN project implements an auction bidding mechanism with a countdown timer. It allows users to place bids on items within the auction, with bids required to be higher than the current highest bid. The auction timer counts down until the end of the bidding period.


## Features

- Countdown timer: Initiates the auction and counts down until the end of the bidding period.

- Highest bid tracking: Keeps track of the highest bid placed by users.
